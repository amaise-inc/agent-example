# legal-i Agent Example (Quarkus)

Example demonstrating the use of the agent SDK from a Quarkus application.

## Development

In the `ExampleService.java` and `ExampleEventService.java`, you see examples of how to call different APIs and subscribe to events. JavaDoc can be downloaded for the SDK module for further explanation and thrown exceptions.

### Application Logic

- After the Quarkus application is initialized, the agent connects to the legal-i cloud.
- If the connection can be established, an Event is published to the `started` Vert.x Event Bus Address.
- This has the following effects:
	- Upon receiving this event, the `ExampleService` creates legal cases and adds source files on the legal-i workspace.
	- The `ExampleEventService` starts listening to events triggered on the API.
		- As an example, he requests a `pong`-Event from the API.
		- This pong will be sent by the API asynchronously and be visible in the EventHandler
- All SDK entities and methods contain JavaDoc annotations.

### Build, run, and monitor
See Makefile for a reference of build targets:

```
make ...
lint        run verify and skip tests
verify      run verify with tests
build       build the agent
dockerize   create agent docker image
run         run docker image
```

The following endpoints are provided in the Example Agent.
```
# Liveness (agent is up)
http://localhost:8080/q/health/live

# Readiness (agent can connect to the legal-i cloud)
http://localhost:8080/q/health/ready

# Prometheus metrics; we recommend setting up alerts on the hearbeat_* counters.
http://localhost:8080/q/metrics

```
